# Imperial Festival

The Sixth Sense project was chosen to be demonstrated at Imperial Festival. This gives the opportunity to explain and demonstrate the project and see what members of the public think of the project and any ideas that they come up with.

The t-shirt wearable will be displayed on a mannequin showing the patterns of vibration. There will also be an experiment which will require volunteers from the members of the public. The use of the t-shirt would be impractical in this case as it needs to be worn underneath the clothing, therefore the experiment will use gloves embedded with motors on the back of the hand.
