# Sixth Sense - Electronically Augmented Perception

This repository contains the code and designs for the Sixth Sense project, the Final Year Project for MEng Electronic and Information Engineering at Imperial College London of Julia Booth.

This project explores the use of electronic sensors to gather information that our natural senses cannot. This information is then communicated to the brain via a less used or new channel, in this case through the sense of touch. The design encorporates vibratory motors in a wearble device which relay information to the brain using spaciotemporally encoded patterns of vibrations. The vibratory motors are controlled wirelessly by an application running on a mobile device such as a smart phone. The prototype application is a GPS navigational aid to give the wearer a sense of direction.

The interim report which introduces the background and preliminary design can be found in the reports folder.
