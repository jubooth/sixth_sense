# Imperial Festival

The Sixth Sense project was chosen to be demonstrated at Imperial Festival. This gives the opportunity to explain and demonstrate the project and see what members of the public think of the project and any ideas that they come up with.

The t-shirt wearable will be displayed on a mannequin showing the patterns of vibration. There will also be an experiment which will require volunteers from the members of the public. The use of the t-shirt would be impractical in this case as it needs to be worn underneath the clothing, therefore the experiment will use gloves embedded with motors on the back of the hand.

Imperial Festival took place 6th to 7th May. The tshirt was displayed and the experiment took place with two different gloves, one small and one large. The experiment evolved quickly from a two part experiment asking the wearer to identify the pattern and then navigate a 3 point path to a simplified version where the subject was asked to identify whether the pattern indicated up, up right, right, down right, down, down left, left or up left by pointing towards a coloured target in each of these directions. The results are shown in Experiment/Results.xls.

The project attracted a lot of interest and ideas. Suggestions uses included gloves/shoes for blind/vision impaired users, car seats and steering wheel covers for drivers and haptic feedback for gaming.
