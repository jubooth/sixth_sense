# Code for the Wearable device

This code is designed to run on an Arduino, used on both Mega ADK and Uno.

Both echoDemo and callbackDemo are examples provided by the manufacturer of the nRF8001 Bluetooth Breakout Board, Adafruit. They both setup connections and allow communication, echoDemo offers 2-way communication, callbackDemo offers communication from the phone to the Arduino. These examples work with the BLE UART Android App also provided by Adafruit. For more details see https://learn.adafruit.com/getting-started-with-the-nrf8001-bluefruit-le-breakout.
