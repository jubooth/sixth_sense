# Imperial Festival Experiment

This experiment will use the gloves detailed in the Device directory. The wearer will be a volunteer.

## Part 1

The first part of the experiment tests the identification of different patterns of vibration with different time periods and motor power.

1. Demonstrate a pattern with the LEDs turned on so that the wearer understands the concept of the patterns

2. Run a pattern without the LEDs and ask the wearer to identify the pattern from a finite list, see glove_patterns.pdf

3. Repeat twice more, recording correctness for each and comparing confusion for each level of power and time period

## Part 2

This part of the experiment tests how intuitive the vibration patterns are as a way of communicating directions to the brain. It uses the tabletop layout shown in part2_table.pdf

Direct a path of 3 hops testing different types of patterns (full, full overlap, single/middle/centre, single/middle/centre overlap).
